# VUE LEAFLET NG
Port of @vue-leaflet/vue-leaflet to try and stop it or Vue or both blowing up. Only ported components I needed:

```
$ ls src/*.vue -1
src/LControl.vue
src/LMap.vue
src/LMarker.vue
src/LPolygon.vue
src/LPolyline.vue
src/LRectangle.vue
src/LTileLayer.vue
```

Maybe WIP. Implementing LPopup or container components where parent child interaction is required is currently too flaky and a wont-fix.
